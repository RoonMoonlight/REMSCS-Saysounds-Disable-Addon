# Remilia's Sven Co-op Server: Saysounds Disable Addon
### What is this?
This is unofficial addon to disable annoying saysounds for Remilia's Sven Co-op server.

This mod replaces most annoying sounds with 5 seconds slienced sound effects, which completely removes any sounds playing when others uses saysound features.

### Why you made this mod?
On Remilia's Discord Server, one of player complained about the saysounds disturbing him. The owner Remi internally discussed about this issue, but remi ignored this issue and asked that player to leave Remilia's server.

After seeing this chat, I wanted to do something for him, and I thought like "I never abandon someone like that! I have to do something to resolve this issue." And finally I completed this mod for players who enjoyed but could not play because of annoying saysound.

### Okay, so what does this mod do?
This mod replaces most sounds downloaded from FastDL with 5 seconds silenced sound, which means completely removing the sounds when people uses saysound feature.

Please note that this does not block all sound effects due to something that I missed, and some saysound files share with specific map (e.g. Gamesaba's maps uses these files, which cannot be removed for better experiences.)

### How to install this?
Can you see the green download button? Press it then click on 'Download ZIP'.

Then Extract zip file, move the `svencoop_downloads` folder to `C:\Program Files (x86)\Steam\steamapps\common\Sven Co-op`. Replace all of the files if asked.

Now you are done! Enjoy the best Rewi experience without distractions.
